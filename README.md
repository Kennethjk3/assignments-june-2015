# Turn-in Instructions

These are the bare minimum instructions you should follow for every assignment.
Additional instructions or direction may be provided in the assignment file, but
always ensure that you follow these steps.

* Create an issue in _this_ repository for every assignment
    * Name it according to the assignment name with your name appended, e.g.
      `1.1 - Personal Website - Robert Pearce`
    * If tasks (i.e. check boxes) are provided for you in the assignment file,
      include them as the _description_ of your WIP Issue
    * If tasks are _not_ provided for you (as in later assignments), create your
      own; you will be expected to break down many assignments on your own
    * Estimate the complexity, difficulty, and risk of each major piece of the
      assignment with T-shirt sizes: Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Extra
      Large (XL)
* _Check off tasks as you finish to demonstrate progress_; note the progress bar
  in [the Issues list](https://github.com/tiy-chs-ruby/assignments-june-2015/issues) for
  each issue
* Create a new repository for the assignment
    * Name the repository according to the assignment, e.g.
      `1.1-personal-website`
    * Create a branch in that repository named `dev`
    * Ensure that you commit _all_ your work into that branch _only_
    * Push that branch to Github regularly to show progress
* Open a Pull Request (PR) from your `dev` branch to `master`
    * [Add a link to your Issue](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/#references)
      in a comment on your Pull Request
    * Note that the PR will update automatically as you push more work to the branch
    * Do this step _as soon as you have a commit_; don't wait until the due date!
