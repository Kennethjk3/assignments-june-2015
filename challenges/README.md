# Challenges
These are problems that you will work on during class. They are not supposed to be turned in nor "graded," so don't bother making PRs or GitHub issues.

## Structure
The folders are structured as `[week].[day]-[challenge_name]`. Simply click on the folder to view the assignment and any relevant files.
