## Details

### Deliverables
* [An issue in the class repo](https://github.com/tiy-chs-ruby/assignments-june-2015) titled `1.1 - User Input -- YOUR NAME` with checkboxes as below under _Requirements_.
* A repository named `1.1-User-Input` containing at least an `assignment.rb` file
* A Pull Request (PR) in your `1.1-User-Input` repo:
  * _from_ branch `develop`
  * _into_ branch master
* A comment on your original Issue with a link to your PR

### Requirements
* This program should prompt for and accept
  * someone's name
  * someone's ideal legal situation

    1. "I am law abiding!"
    1. "I make sure others obey the law."

  1. `__name__, aren't you a little short for a Storm Trooper?`
  1. `Hey, __name__! Who's scruffy-lookin'?`
  1. `__name__, I loathe bounty hunters. We don't need their scum...`
  1. `__name__, meesa Jar Jar Binks.`

### Tasks
- [ ] Create a new Issue with these tasks!
- [ ] Use the Github web interface to create a repository called `1.1-User-Input`
- [ ] Use the Github web interface to create a branch called on `1.1-User-Input` called `<initials>-develop`
- [ ] In Github, open a PR from `<initials>-develop` into `master`
- [ ] Create the Quick Star Wars Character test
  - [ ] Checkpoint: Create `assignment.rb`
  - [ ] Checkpoint: Store a person's name from a prompt
  - [ ] Checkpoint: Store a person's legal preference
  - [ ] Checkpoint: Perform logic on the legal preference
  - [ ] Checkpoint: Return one of the required strings back to the user.
